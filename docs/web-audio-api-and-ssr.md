# Web Audio and Server Side Rendering

The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API" target="blank">Web Audio API</a> is naturally only accessible in client-side environments. This adds a layer of complexity when developing Vue audio applications that utilize SSR. Via lifecycle hooks such as <a href="https://vuejs.org/api/composition-api-lifecycle#onmounted" target="blank">onMounted()</a>, v-audio-ui components are designed to be SSR-compatible so they can easily be dropped in to popular frameworks such as <a target="blank" href="https://nuxt.com/">Nuxt</a>, <a target="blank" href="https://quasar.dev/">Quasar</a> and <a target="blank" href="https://vitepress.dev/">VitePress</a>. Using lifecycle hooks and custom callbacks is recommended for ensuring that no Web Audio API code is executed server-side when developing your own application.
